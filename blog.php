                            <h4><span>"</span> Happy Blood Donating Day <span>"</span></h4>
                            
                            <p>June 14 is World Blood Donar Day. The purpose of this day is to encourage the general public to donate blood, including those who are saving millions of lives by donating blood voluntarily and for free.</p>
                            <p>World Blood Donar Day was first celebrated in 2004 following the experience of International Blood Donor Day since 1995 and World Health Day celebrated in 2000 with the theme 'Safe Blood'. Every year since the World Health Assembly in 2005, the World Health Organization has been urging to observe this day.</p>
                            <p>80 million units of blood are voluntarily donated every year, but only 38 percent of it is collected from developing countries, home to 82 percent of the world's population. Apart from this, still in many countries of the world, if people need blood, they have to rely on the blood donation of their family members or their friends, and in many countries, professional blood donors have been donating blood to patients in exchange for money. However, by collecting data from various countries of the world, it is known that the main basis of 'safe blood supply' is voluntary and free blood donation. Because their blood is relatively safe and the risk of life-threatening infections, such as HIV and hepatitis, in recipients is very low.</p>
                            <p>World Blood Donor Day on June 14 is dedicated to those hidden heroes who voluntarily and freely donate blood, to these unsung heroes. The celebration of 14th June has another significance. Scientist Carl Lundsteiner was born on this day. This Nobel laureate scientist discovered the blood group 'A, B, O, AB'. Donating blood is a great gift. Donating blood does not cause any harm to the body. In fact, blood cells are destroyed after a certain period of time. <br> <span>So donate blood, save the patient's life.</span></p>
